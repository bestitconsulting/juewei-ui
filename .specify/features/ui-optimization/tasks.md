## Parallel Execution Examples

### Font and Image Tasks (T011-T027)
These tasks can run in parallel as they don't depend on each other:
- T011, T012, T013, T014 (font system) can run parallel with T018-T027 (image organization)
- T015, T016, T017 (font testing) can run parallel with T024-T027 (image cleanup)

### CSS and Performance Tasks (T028-T041)
These tasks can run in parallel after foundational tasks complete:
- T028-T035 (CSS architecture) can run parallel with T036-T041 (performance optimization)
- Component-specific CSS updates can run independently

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5 seconds
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5 seconds
- **CSS Bundle Size**: 20% reduction

### Quality Targets
- **Font Loading Time**: 30% improvement
- **Image File Sizes**: 25% reduction
- **CSS Organization**: 90% follows patterns
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### User Experience Targets
- **Typography**: 15% readability improvement
- **Mobile Performance**: Optimized for restaurant customers
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintained design system
- **Brand Identity**: Preserved food brand aesthetics

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Path
1. **T001-T010**: Setup and foundational tasks (must complete first)
2. **T011-T041**: US1 implementation (P1 priority)
3. **T042-T050**: US2 implementation (P2 priority)
4. **T051-T059**: US3 implementation (P3 priority)
5. **T060-T072**: Polish and validation

### Risk Mitigation
- Font loading: Maintain fallback fonts for Chinese text
- Image optimization: Preserve existing R2 infrastructure
- CSS changes: Incremental updates to avoid breaking changes
- Performance: Continuous monitoring during implementation

### Testing Strategy
- Each user story has independent test criteria
- Performance testing at each phase
- Accessibility testing throughout implementation
- Cross-browser testing before completion
