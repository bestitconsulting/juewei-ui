# Tasks: R2 Image Migration

**Feature**: R2 Image Migration  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Ready for Implementation  
**Total Tasks**: 45  

## Overview

This document breaks down the R2 Image Migration feature into actionable, dependency-ordered tasks. The migration involves moving all static images from the local `/public` directory to Cloudflare R2 bucket 'juewei-assets' for improved performance and global CDN distribution.

## User Stories & Priorities

Based on the feature specification, the following user stories have been identified:

- **US1 (P1)**: Website Visitor Loading Images - Users can load all images from R2 CDN with improved performance
- **US2 (P2)**: Developer Updating Images - Developers can update images without code deployments
- **US3 (P3)**: Content Manager Adding Products - Content managers can add new products with images

## Dependencies

### Story Completion Order
1. **US1** (P1) - Must complete first (core functionality)
2. **US2** (P2) - Depends on US1 (builds on core functionality)
3. **US3** (P3) - Depends on US1 and US2 (extends functionality)

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- Environment setup tasks can run in parallel
- Image upload tasks can be parallelized
- Component updates can be done in parallel
- Testing tasks can run concurrently

- <0.1% error rate for image requests
- Graceful degradation with local fallback when R2 unavailable
- Basic monitoring (CDN hit rate, error rate only)
- Cache busting with timestamp versioning
- Fail-silent error handling for failed image loads

## Risk Mitigation

### Fallback Strategy:
- Keep local images during transition
- Implement graceful degradation with local fallback
- Fail-silent error handling for failed image loads
- Monitor R2 availability with basic monitoring
- Alert on CDN hit rate and error rate issues

### Rollback Plan:
- Maintain local image copies during migration

- Gradual migration approach
- Comprehensive testing at each step

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Phase 1**: Set up R2 bucket and CDN configuration
2. **Complete Phase 2**: Implement foundational utilities and components
3. **Execute Phase 3**: Migrate images and update components (MVP)
4. **Extend with Phase 4-5**: Add developer and content manager functionality
5. **Polish with Phase 6**: Add monitoring, cleanup, and optimization
6. **Implement Phase 7**: Add clarified requirements (fallback, error handling, versioning, monitoring)

## Notes

- All tasks are designed to be independently testable
- Each phase builds upon the previous phases
- Parallel execution opportunities are clearly identified
- File paths are specified for each task
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Risk mitigation strategies are included for each phase
